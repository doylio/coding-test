# Instructions

You have been given the task of salvaging the comments feature of our platform. An inexperienced developer started this project, but was unable to complete it. Now it has been handed to you to pick up where they left off and complete the assignment.

## Assignment

Create the frontend for a comment system in our platform. Attached is an image from the designer.

- As a user, I should be able to see the past comments so that I can learn what my coworkers are discussing
- As a user, I should be able to create a comment so I can communicate with my coworkers
- As a user, I can see when my comment has an error (over 140 characters) so that I can change it

## Design

The designer has given you this design to work with.  For the purposes of this exercise, you can ignore the header and footer

## Notes

- We are interested in seeing how you go about writing code based on a design, but don't stress to much about being 100% accurate to the design. If the colors or margins aren't pixel perfect that's ok
- We want to see how you work with other people's code. Feel free to change as much or as little of the previous developer's code as you want
