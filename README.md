# Assignment

Create the frontend for a comment system in our platform. Attached is an image from the designer.

- As a user, I should be able to see the past comments so that I can learn what my coworkers are discussing
- As a user, I should be able to create a comment so I can communicate with my coworkers
- As a user, I can see when my comment has an error (over 140 characters) so that I can change it

## Design

The designer has given you this design to work with.  For the purposes of this exercise, you can ignore the header and footer

## Notes

- We are interested in seeing how you go about writing code based on a design, but don't stress to much about being 100% accurate to the design. If the colors or margins aren't pixel perfect that's ok
